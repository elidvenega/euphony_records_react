      Euphony records was founded because of my love for music wanting to
      provide music records of different genres to people I decided to open a
      record store. We host local acts on weekends to give them exposure, as
      well as sponsor many community events as a way to give back to the
      community. Our mission is just to expose to bring people together through
      music.
