          Euphony records was founded because of my love for music wanting to
          provide music records of different genres to people I decided to open
          a record store. We host local acts on weekends to give them exposure,
          as well as sponsor many community events as a way to give back to the
          community. Our mission is just to expose to bring people together
          through music.
