# Euphony Records

A music store made using React and React Router, the project was about me working on React and how to work with a library. It was a challenge the project helped me learn how to work with React and convert my HTML and CSS project into React. I learned how to separate my project into components. How to think in React as well as how to implement SCSS into the project to better manage my CSS.
